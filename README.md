# Park 'N Go
### The communal parking app

## About
Park 'N Go was a side project started by my university friend and I aimed at bringing the closes parking (both free and paid) to peopke driving. We started with parking spots only in Toronto, Ontario, but recently expanded with over 20,000 parking spots all across the United States. I build the web app with jQuery UI and custonized it to suit what I needed. Work on Park 'N Go kinda slowed down when I moved out to San Francisco for a 4 month internship, but I'm going to continue working on it with my friend when we get back. Any and all help is appreciated.

## Features
1. Embedded auto-complete location search
2. Info windows right in the map
3. Ability for users to easily add spots to the database
4. A Craigslist like area where users can rent out parking spots they aren't using

## To-Be-Included
1. Revamp the layout of the info windows
  * I want to to replace manual entry with pictures of parking signs. Makes the whole process WAY faster
2. Only load the parking spots that are in the current map area (I currently load every parking spot at once. Shhh. I know, its horrible).

## Where I Want To Go
1. Getting the iOS app working.
  * I just mocked up a layout in some spare time that I had. It doesnt do anything except display where you are.
2.
